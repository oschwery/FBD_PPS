# FBD_PPS
Adequacy for Fossilized Birth Death

## Suggested structure
- original data and scripts are in Basanta's `rjMCMC` repo
- FBD inferences (trees, logs) are on lab drive `PosteriorPredictive/time_homo_ants`
- PPS code in my repo `FBD_PPS/src` (this one)

- get inferences from local copy of drive folder and run PPS
- save PPS sims in local drive under `PPS_output`
- summarise PPS sims (by summary statistics) and save them in `FBD_PPS/results`
- same for pvalues, plots, and everything else downstream...
