# check if last line is complete, in case run completed by crashing

# remove line 2 to what determined in Tracer (/10) and save as new file

# now change file_stem to "antsSA2" in run_PPS.Rev and run
# Also remember to turn run mcmc off
  # included a switch and loop, but copy it over and DON'T replace the whole file, to preserve the initial settings


# for summarising, remember to change which trait model it is!
# manually remove the [ and ] for now
